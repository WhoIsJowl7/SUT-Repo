# **Landfill Labs - Test Suite Repository**

This repository contains the test cases developed for validating the Landfill Labs codebase. It serves as the System Under Test (SUT) where all automated tests have been implemented and executed.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive suite of tests that ensure the correctness, reliability, and robustness of the Landfill Labs application. These tests cover various functionalities including waste processing calculations, recycling centre selection, and travel time computations.

## Contents

Test cases covering the major components of the Landfill Labs system.

Tests designed to verify handling of different waste materials, recycling centre generations, and edge cases such as invalid inputs or zero waste amounts.

Utilities and mocks where necessary to isolate units under test.

Detailed assertions and output to assist in verification and debugging.

## Tools and Technologies Used

Java (version compatible with the Landfill Labs code)

JUnit 5 for test implementation and execution

Maven for build management and running the test suite

## Running the Tests

Tests can be run easily using Maven commands or within an IDE supporting JUnit. This ensures rapid feedback on code changes and continuous validation of system behaviour.
